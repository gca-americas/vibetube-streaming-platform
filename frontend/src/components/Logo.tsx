/**
 * The Vibetube lockup.
 *
 * The supplied artwork is a raster trace, so its wordmark is baked in as
 * hundreds of near-black fills and cannot be recoloured from CSS.
 * `logo-dark.svg` is a generated variant with every dark tone reflected up
 * around mid-lightness, hue and saturation preserved; the right file is chosen
 * by theme rather than rendering both and hiding one, which would still cost
 * the download.
 *
 * The travelling sweep in `.logo-shine` is masked with the same file, so the
 * light runs through the letterforms instead of over a rectangle.
 *
 * Falls back to a type-only wordmark if the asset is missing.
